                <br>
                <p>People began settling in Norway very early - in 9000 BC, in fact. This was after the end of the first ice age, so it was now an inhabitable location. Settlers survived by hunting and fishing animals such as seal, deer, elk and whales. Farming didn't become prominent until 500 BC, which was known as the bronze age. This time period got its name from the various weapons and jewelry created.</p>

                        <p style="color: black;">We felt lucky to be in a new electric boat which was in service for just a month. Two decks of fully heated seating area . The tour guide was in English very nice lady who presented with wit and pleasant to listen to. We sat in the upper deck and the view was breathtaking. The bar located in the lower deck sold refreshments and alcohol. On the upper deck you could also go into the open space (-4degree) to take photographs or view the tour in the cold. Despite everything being expensive in Norway, we felt this ride was value for money. Highly recommend to see the Oslo fjord via this pleasant silent sustainable mode. Excellent service</p>

The Sami culture chat was so interesting and good fun as well especially the yoik. The reindeers were lovely and it was so much fun feeding them. You get unlimited food for them and trust me they keep going and going. The sleigh ride was also so magical, and we were even lucky enough to see the lights. The meal was lovely and had GF and DF options and vegetarian. Thank you so much for the experience it was so lovely.</p>
